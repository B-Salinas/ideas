IDEAS 

Initially inspired by 0xngmi's (https://github.com/0xngmi) ideas repo (https://github.com/0xngmi/ideas) 
but brought back to life after reading "The hoarding mentality is a creative dead end" by Rick Rubin. 

Disclaimer: I'm not an expert on any of these subjects. I'm sure that if I was, some of these ideas would seem obvious or impossible. Either way, they exist.
